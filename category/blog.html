<h2>The new social media</h2>
<p>If you haven't heard yet, I've joined a new social media platform called Mastodon. It's one of many platforms on <a href="https://fediverse.party/en/fediverse/" target="_blank">"The Fediverse"</a>, where a bunch of different social media platforms co-exist. </p>
<p>Long story short, I'm inviting people to join me!</p>

<h2>Why join?</h2>
<p></a>
Social media these days is creepy, and at worst downright harmful. Platforms like Facebook &amp; Instagram spy on you to sell you products, ideas and even just memes. They jumble it all together on a mysterious feed that you don't control then it selectively shows content from friends at random (often just sharing the same ads) to keep you coming back so it actually has any meaning.</p>
<p>In short, it's hard to actually connect with people. It's like being in a bar so noisy that you can barely think over the ads to buy beer blaring over the speakers.</p>
<p>The Fediverse is seeking to change that. It allows you to build an online community that's better connected. It allows that community to run things how it wants while still being connected to other servers and platforms doing the exact same thing so it's still global.</p>
<p>I'm inviting you to come build that community.</p>
<p><a name="community-building"></p>
<h3>Building a community</h3>
<p></a>
I use the word <em>build</em> on purpose, because it's going to take some effort to make this happen. If I just shared this without reaching out directly, you'd probably miss it or scroll passed. Facebook has gone to great lengths to build a particular kind of community, one that collectively consumes information for sale. It's not an accident that it operates the way it does.</p>
<p>To build an alternative also means doing it on purpose then, but it's worth the effort. On one hand, I want to connect with friends and see how y'all are doing without it getting lost in Facebook's manipulative bullshit. You don't have to be political, think a certain way or have any goals in mind. This is not a hivemind. You can share memes, jokes, posts about your day or whatever game/movie you're checking out right now. </p>
<p>Use this space how you like! That's an important part of what I mean by building and fostering a community.</p>
<p>Just as importantly though, I see this as a way to stay connected to people I know who care about the world. Because of resource limitations, and also to maintain a cohesive community, I've reached out selectively to some close friends that I think would be interested in this project to start. </p>
<p>You should feel free to invite others too! I trust your judgement. I think you're all really cool people that are worth staying in touch with. If it gets too big though we might have to talk about upgrading resources or bring on people to help moderate lol.</p>
<p>What I'm trying to say though is that in order to deal with the bullshit that the world is going through right now, it's also good to have this space to talk to one another without all the distractions and censorship. Not only is community important, but so is how it's built.</p>
<p>You don't even have to leave Facebook either if you don't want to. That's the beauty of this, it's not exclusive. It's just a quieter place where you can  still be social without wading through a toxic swamp.</p>
<p><a name="join"></p>
<h2>How do I join social.putz.space?</h2>
<p></a>
Ready to dive in? It's simple! Just sign up for an account at <a href="http://social.putz.space" target="_blank">social.putz.space</a>. Choose your name then let me know either why you're joining or just who you are if I know you. Once registered, I'll approve your account when I get the email notification.</p>
<p>Since I have limited space I'm sticking to either approving friends or friends of friends. As we grow, things may start to get slower, in which case I'll have to upgrade my hosting plan. Don't let that stop you from joining though, I'm just putting out a warning in case you see sign-ups are closed at some point or any technical difficulties.</p>
<p>If you're joining, then take some time to read the information below to get familiar with the platform! Others have written at length too about Mastodon, so you can google something if it's not here. There are apps for every device you can think of too, so if you don't like using a web browser <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/apps" target="_blank">check out the apps</a>.</p>
<p><a name="faq"></p>
<h2>F.A.Q: How does it work?</h2>
<p></a>
There are technically other servers where you can sign up, but I've opened up my own server with the purpose of connecting people I know. Think of it as being in my living room or out on the porch chillin'.</p>
<p>The following is all just a brief explanation of a few things that can be helpful to read about either before joining or as you're diving in. Please comment on the Local timeline if you have questions! I may update this document to reflect people's questions.</p>
<p><a name="technical"></p>
<h3>Technical details</h3>
<p></a>
Mastodon works similarly to Twitter, but without so many assholes. In essence you can post 500 character statuses, upload images, gifs and videos less than 8MB in size, share and like posts called "toots" because, you know, Mastodons (the cute little mascot of the platform) have trunks like elephants. There are feeds you can follow.</p>
<p>Everyone gets a handle, but since it's federated and not everyone is on the same server it looks more like an email address. For instance, my handle is <a href="https://social.putz.space/@pootz" target="_blank">@pootz@social.putz.space</a>. Yours would be @you@social.putz.space.</p>
<p>Following people is pretty much done in the same way as most platforms: just click on the user and then click Follow.</p>
<p>If you want to share your content to users not on Mastodon, clicking the link above to my user page will show you how they'll see it if you link them stuff.</p>
<p><a name="timelines"></p>
<h3>Timelines</h3>
<p></a>
A slight difference from Twitter is how the timelines work. There are three: <strong>Personal, Local and Federated</strong>. The <strong>Personal</strong> timeline shows you the posts &amp; boosts from people you follow. Pretty easy.</p>
<p>The <strong>Local</strong> timeline is the place where everyone who is on my server can talk to each other. Here's a picture of how it looks now. As more people join, it will have more going on.</p>
<p><img alt="the local timeline" src="https://putz.space/images/articles/putz-social-local-timeline.png" /></p>
<p>The <strong>Federated</strong> timeline is where you can see everyone who is posting on the <strong>Local</strong> timeline, people who who are followed by anyone on the server as well as boosted posts of the people those people follow. It starts out small, but grows as people connect more. I'm looking into connecting to a relay as well to have an even bigger audience without having to manually follow people.</p>
<p>The <strong>Local</strong> timeline is perhaps the one that will interest people the most, but you may find other users that you like on the Federated timeline as well, so go ahead and follow them if you'd like. It's important to note that the culture is very unique in both good and weird ways given the nature of Mastodon as a platform. It's meant to be an alternative space, so you'll find nerds of all flavors (particularly in tech), people who care about social justice, shit posters and more depending on who our community is into.</p>
<p>Right now it's fairly quiet though. A server like <a href="http://mastodon.social" target="_blank">mastodon.social</a> has a pretty active federated timeline that moves fast.</p>
<p><a name="filtering-feeds"></p>
<h3>Filtering feeds</h3>
<p></a>
Mastodon is about putting control of the feed back into not only community hands, but your hands.</p>
<p>If you find someone annoying, just block them, mute them, or even report them if they're on my own server or especially if anyone from the Federated timeline is harassing people here. </p>
<p>You can also create lists of users based on topics or as groups. I'm still learning about the different ways to filter feeds, but the point is you have control over your feed. So feel free to use it.</p>
<p>You can also use hashtags or word filters to filter your feeds as well I've heard.</p>
<p><a name="filtering-posts"></p>
<h3>Filtering posts</h3>
<p></a>
Like Twitter, you can use hashtags to search and tag your posts. If you want to talk about music you can search #music or post with #music in your post so others can find it.</p>
<p>If you haven't already, you should make a post with the #introductions tag to introduce yourself!</p>
<p>Another thing you'll probably find is Content Warnings. If you're not sure that others want to read what you're writing about (politics, negative thoughts, spoilers for a movie, or NSFW stuff), or if you just want to put a title to the topic you're posting about, you can filter your posts by using a Content Warning. It appears as a button labeled "CW" in the same area where you make posts. It's up to you how to use it.</p>
<p>Some common Content Warnings are: lewd (nudes), pol (politics), selfie ec/no-ec (eye contact or no eye contact in the selfie), spoilers, or just posts that are long with the topic it's about as the Warning. You can create your own or ignore it, it's mostly a courtesy thing that's not well integrated into other platforms so it may be new to you.</p>
<p><a name="conclusion"></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p></a>
That's the long and short of it. I may have missed a thing or two, but I'm curious to see where things go. I'm pretty open in where to take things, but I figured that there's no harm in trying. If you want to join me on this project then again, just sign up for an account at <a href="http://social.putz.space">http://social.putz.space</a>, it's easy!</p>
<p>See you on the inside.</p>

I thought it would be a good time to reflect on my experiences not only dating, but now also maintaining a relationship. It may not be my first, but it's been a pretty awesome journey. I hope this will be useful to those interested in talking about and learning more on both, but mostly I just know younger me would have appreciated these notes lol. Long but good, enjoy!</p>
