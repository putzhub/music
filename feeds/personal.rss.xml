Here's an explanation of why I did that and an introduction.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">putz</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 27 Mar 2020 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:putz.space,2020-03-27:/blog/hello-neighbors/</guid><category>blog</category><category>personal</category><category>social</category></item><item><title>Why I Left Facebook</title><link>https://putz.space/blog/leaving-facebook/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Well, I didn't even make it a whole year. Hell, I barely made it six months and I'm already deleting Facebook again. &lt;a href="https://putz.space/blog/returning-to-facebook/"&gt;Since I made such a big spectacle of coming back&lt;/a&gt;, I'll take some time to explain why I'm leaving just in case you actually care. Long story short, I didn't feel connected to any of my friends and it was depressimg as hell.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">putz</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2019 18:11:17 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:putz.space,2019-10-09:/blog/leaving-facebook/</guid><category>blog</category><category>personal</category></item><item><title>Love, dating and relationships</title><link>https://putz.space/blog/two-years-together/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Recently my partner and I celebrated our two year anniversary. I thought it would be a good time to reflect on my experiences not only dating, but now also maintaining a relationship. It may not be my first, but it's been a pretty awesome journey. I hope this will be useful to those interested in talking about and learning more on both, but mostly I just know younger me would have appreciated these notes lol. Long but good, enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">putz</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 09 Aug 2019 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:putz.space,2019-08-09:/blog/two-years-together/</guid><category>blog</category><category>personal</category><category>dating</category><category>self-help</category></item><item><title>Happy birthday to me!</title><link>https://putz.space/blog/happy-bday-to-me/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I decided to do an open reflection for my 25th birthday. It's definitely weird being an adult, but I'm hoping to get back into music and find time for exciting new stuff. Mostly I just wanted to let people who haven't heard from me in a while know how things are going. Hope you're doing well!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">putz</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2019 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:putz.space,2019-07-23:/blog/happy-bday-to-me/</guid><category>blog</category><category>personal</category></item><item><title>Ways to replace Facebook</title><link>https://putz.space/blog/ways-to-replace-facebook/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;A friend on my feed recently shared a story about a day in the life of a Facebook moderator, which unsurprisingly isn't a great time. After reading it they were asking themself if they could genuinely leave Facebook. That inspired me to ask the question on my feed "What keeps you on Facebook?", hoping that I could write about my experience leaving and what I did to replace the things that kept me there. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">putz</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jun 2019 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:putz.space,2019-06-26:/blog/ways-to-replace-facebook/</guid><category>blog</category><category>personal</category><category>tech</category><category>self-help</category></item><item><title>How I keep it together</title><link>https://putz.space/blog/keep-it-together/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;A while back in college I decided to start keeping a daily log and to-do list. That sparked a few routines that I started to use to keep my life together. I figured some people might find it helpful if I reflected on that journey and how I started adulting. So yeah, enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">putz</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jun 2019 15:15:32 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:putz.space,2019-06-01:/blog/keep-it-together/</guid><category>blog</category><category>diy</category><category>life</category><category>self-help</category><category>personal</category></item><item><title>Returning to Facebook</title><link>https://putz.space/blog/returning-to-facebook/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I'm curious who out there were placing bets on when I'd be back on facebook lol. Well, I made a pretty big stink when I left, so I wrote up a blog post to explain why I'm back because I'm sure everyone is as shocked as I am (or not lol). I was on Mastodon and Reddit, but nobody I know really uses them so I figured I'd come back. Most of you are on here and the people is what makes social media meaningful. So what up what up yo.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">putz</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 13 Apr 2019 19:58:10 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:putz.space,2019-04-13:/blog/returning-to-facebook/</guid><category>blog</category><category>personal</category></item><item><title>Hello World!</title><link>https://putz.space/blog/hello-world/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! So it's probably been a while since you've heard from me because I dropped off of facebook and started interacting way less with social media. For many people reading this we probably haven't talked since I was in college. Even if we have, it probably hasn't been as …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">putz</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2019 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:putz.space,2019-04-10:/blog/hello-world/</guid><category>blog</category><category>personal</category></item><item><title>Updates</title><link>https://putz.space/blog/2019-03-18-updates/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Been working on the stylesheet all night and I think it's in a place where the experience should hopefully be a little better finally, especially for mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically the only thing I have to do now is set up a system for making posts (or just learning Markdown and type …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">putz</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2019 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:putz.space,2019-03-18:/blog/2019-03-18-updates/</guid><category>blog</category><category>personal</category></item><item><title>Website launch</title><link>https://putz.space/blog/website-launch/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Well hello there! I'm starting a website because I want to have a place where 
people can stay in touch with me and see what I'm up to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just recently switched to pelican to run things because it offers more
powerful tools for running a blog than &lt;a href="http://zim-wiki.org"&gt;zim-wiki&lt;/a&gt;, which …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">putz</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 12 Mar 2019 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:putz.space,2019-03-12:/blog/website-launch/</guid><category>blog</category><category>personal</category></item></channel></rss>
