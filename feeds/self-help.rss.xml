I thought it would be a good time to reflect on my experiences not only dating, but now also maintaining a relationship. It may not be my first, but it's been a pretty awesome journey. I hope this will be useful to those interested in talking about and learning more on both, but mostly I just know younger me would have appreciated these notes lol. Long but good, enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">putz</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 09 Aug 2019 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:putz.space,2019-08-09:/blog/two-years-together/</guid><category>blog</category><category>personal</category><category>dating</category><category>self-help</category></item><item><title>Ways to replace Facebook</title><link>https://putz.space/blog/ways-to-replace-facebook/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;A friend on my feed recently shared a story about a day in the life of a Facebook moderator, which unsurprisingly isn't a great time. After reading it they were asking themself if they could genuinely leave Facebook. That inspired me to ask the question on my feed "What keeps you on Facebook?", hoping that I could write about my experience leaving and what I did to replace the things that kept me there. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">putz</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jun 2019 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:putz.space,2019-06-26:/blog/ways-to-replace-facebook/</guid><category>blog</category><category>personal</category><category>tech</category><category>self-help</category></item><item><title>How I keep it together</title><link>https://putz.space/blog/keep-it-together/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;A while back in college I decided to start keeping a daily log and to-do list. That sparked a few routines that I started to use to keep my life together. I figured some people might find it helpful if I reflected on that journey and how I started adulting. So yeah, enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">putz</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jun 2019 15:15:32 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:putz.space,2019-06-01:/blog/keep-it-together/</guid><category>blog</category><category>diy</category><category>life</category><category>self-help</category><category>personal</category></item></channel></rss>
