I tried a thing and it failed. Here's the post-mortem for it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">putz</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 22 Nov 2019 13:22:53 -0600</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:putz.space,2019-11-22:/blog/putz-social-post-mortem/</guid><category>blog</category><category>tech</category><category>social</category></item><item><title>Making friends on Mastodon</title><link>https://putz.space/blog/making-friends-mastodon/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Now that you've got an account on social.putz.space and know how to use Mastodon, the only thing left is finding people. More than just following people though, the Fediverse offers a cool space to meet people you wouldn't meet elsewhere. Let's learn how to make friends and follow people!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">putz</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2019 20:38:03 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:putz.space,2019-09-09:/blog/making-friends-mastodon/</guid><category>blog</category><category>tech</category><category>social</category><category>mastodon</category></item><item><title>Introduction to Mastodon</title><link>https://putz.space/blog/intro-to-mastodon/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I decided to create a quick start guide for people to reference that's visually focused. I didn't find any guides that I particularly liked for onboarding a complete beginner, so I made my own.

This is an invitation to folks to join. I've sent it to people directly as a way to ask if they're interested, but if you happen to stumble across this on accident feel free to read it over. Register if it makes you interested!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">putz</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2019 14:53:39 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:putz.space,2019-09-01:/blog/social/</guid><category>blog</category><category>tech</category><category>social</category></item><item><title>Ways to replace Facebook</title><link>https://putz.space/blog/ways-to-replace-facebook/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;A friend on my feed recently shared a story about a day in the life of a Facebook moderator, which unsurprisingly isn't a great time. After reading it they were asking themself if they could genuinely leave Facebook. That inspired me to ask the question on my feed "What keeps you on Facebook?", hoping that I could write about my experience leaving and what I did to replace the things that kept me there. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">putz</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jun 2019 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:putz.space,2019-06-26:/blog/ways-to-replace-facebook/</guid><category>blog</category><category>personal</category><category>tech</category><category>self-help</category></item></channel></rss>
