&lt;p&gt;New beat! This one is a little old, but since I haven't had an outlet to post music to I haven't really put it out there. It's called "Forward", because that's what I was feeling in my life at the time (and still feel). Recorded with my Casio CTK-720, which is the derpy piano I got in middle school that's pictured above. Used renoise to mix and master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="music"></category><category term="demo"></category></entry><entry><title>Returning to Facebook</title><link href="https://putz.space/2019/04/13/returning-to-facebook/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-04-13T19:58:10-05:00</published><updated>2019-04-13T19:58:10-05:00</updated><author><name>putz</name></author><id>tag:putz.space,2019-04-13:/2019/04/13/returning-to-facebook/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm curious who out there were placing bets on when I'd be back on facebook lol. Well, I made a pretty big stink when I left, so I wrote up a blog post to explain why I'm back because I'm sure everyone is as shocked as I am (or not lol). I was on Mastodon and Reddit, but nobody I know really uses them so I figured I'd come back. Most of you are on here and the people is what makes social media meaningful. So what up what up yo.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Facebook banner" src="https://putz.space/blog/covers/returning-to-facebook.png" id="article-image" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after a long break from Facebook I'm finally back again to the shock of everyone lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I originally deleted Facebook (the first time), I got a bunch of friend's email addresses hoping to stay in touch directly. However, that never happened because quite frankly there's just too many people to stay in touch with and not enough time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I also just needed some time to focus on myself. I was addicted to the notifications that kept me in a loop of constantly rechecking, without thinking, any time I was remotely bored and needed something to keep me busy. I would immediately type out "facebook.com" into my browser and it would suck up a lot of valuable free time without actually feeling connected to people. So I got rid of it. I opened and deleted a Facebook account here or there a few more times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last time, I decided to reopen it for promoting my music, but really just used that to talk about politics all the time. I also became increasingly concerned with how it spies on us and the implications that will have politically in the future, but now that everything spies on us all the time it feels like a moot point. As an ironic joke ask an Alexa, Siri or Google "What is 1984 by George Orwell?" then record it and share its response, just curious what it says lol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, leaving was good for me because it allowed me the space to focus on myself. I focused more on my to-do list, journaling and setting personal goals that I would look at when I was bored instead of Facebook. I recommend this to anyone who feels like they're in a rut and I might write something up in a future blog post about my own personal methods of doing this. It has allowed me to control myself better and has given me mental tools to stay focused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was good for a time, but lately I've started to feel the alienation that comes with being disconnected from so many people I used to talk to. The community-based alternatives on the &lt;a href="https://fediverse.party/en/fediverse/"&gt;fediverse&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href="http://joinmastodon.org"&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt; are cool and show what's possible for social media in the future, but nobody I know is on them yet so they're a bit lonely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm back because, well frankly, I miss you guys and seeing where you're at in life. Now that I'm an adult, life is a lot busier and I'm sure many of you can relate. Lots of old friends I used to be in touch with are off on adventures in different parts of the world, or paying bills and adulting with actual children that y'all are now raising. Crazy stuff!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What finally pushed me over the edge to hop back on Facebook though was: on reddit I saw a comment thread on one of the many articles regarding &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-migrants-sanctuary-cities-20190412-story.html"&gt;Trump's plan to drop off immigrants into sanctuary cities&lt;/a&gt; as... a punishment to the Democrats I guess? I mean shit, those families would happily leave the cages they're in and most people in the comments wanted to welcome them to their community anyway. That's a reflection of the moment we live in. Where it seems like things are so goddamn bad, but actually the potential to make it better is bustling beneath the seams ready to explode because people know things should be better than this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we need right now is community that can support one another in the face of being torn apart by whatever storm society is going through. So I wanted to reconnect with mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Putz&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S: I started my own website again, which you're on right now. More on that here: &lt;a href="https://putz.space/2019/04/03/hello-world/"&gt;Hello World!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="personal"></category></entry><entry><title>Hello World!</title><link href="https://putz.space/2019/04/03/hello-world/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-04-03T23:08:53-05:00</published><updated>2019-04-03T23:08:53-05:00</updated><author><name>putz</name></author><id>tag:putz.space,2019-04-03:/2019/04/03/hello-world/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone!

So it's probably been a while since you've heard from me because I dropped off of facebook and started interacting way less with social media. For many people reading this we probably haven't talked since I was in college. Even if we have, it probably hasn't been as frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've decided to start this website as one way for people to see what I'm up to. I realize this probably won't be something most people come back to regularly, if at all, but since you're reading this I figured I'd let you know what I'm up to anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought &lt;a href="#"&gt;putz.space&lt;/a&gt; as a way to have a consistent email since I finally decided to switch away from gmail as my primary email. Check the &lt;a href="https://putz.space/about/"&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; page if you want to send me an email or connect on social media. You can still technically reach me at my old email, it just might get lost with all the unread emails lol. After buying a domain name though, it was a logical next step to start a website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually had a website back in middle and high school that I worked on as a hobby for myself. I'd like to do that again. I want it to be the central place where you can go to see what I'm up to. In fact, if you want me to link to what &lt;em&gt;you're&lt;/em&gt; doing, then let me know and I can make a page for my friends who are doing cool shit too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing that made the most sense to me is obviously hosting my music, because I am Groove Masta Putz after all lol. In fact, if you're interested in a mailing list for any new tracks, &lt;a href="mailto:inbox@putz.space"&gt;email me&lt;/a&gt; and I'll add you for when I actually make one in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I've also been trying to think of what else might be interesting to people. So another thing I'd like to try is write up tutorials and other useful posts for stuff that can guide people through some things that I've done like: make this website, how I organize my life, how to follow news sources without Facebook or Reddit, or how to hack your wii to play all the dope old school games and much more. If there's something else you'd like to see let me know! Ideas are welcome and they don't have to be nerd shit either necessarily. I just want to motivate myself to do cool things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm still figuring this out as I go, but I'm trying to think big. The most exciting thing to me is having an online space again that's mine. With facebook and other social media I no longer felt like the people I care about were seeing me behind all the ads and secret algorithms. Plus, it was limited and a full website gives me more control over what I can host and how. For example, I can take my &lt;a href="https://putz.space/music/"&gt;music&lt;/a&gt; page more seriously and get in-depth about each song and its history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lot more I want to say, but I guess that's what future blog posts will be for. Hope y'all are doing well out there, it's a crazy world these days. Definitely weird to be an adult now, but that's just how it be, huh. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically the only thing I have to do now is set up a system for making posts (or just learning Markdown and type it up in a text editor I guess like a nerd lol), figure out how I want to host my music and I think from there most of the setup should be done. Anyway, hopefully this will be the start a of a long fruitful journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll see if it's worth it to do blogging or not. You can catch me on other social media found either in the &lt;a href="../pages/about.html"&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; page or in the footer for the real shitposts though lol.&lt;/p&gt;
