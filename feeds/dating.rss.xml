I thought it would be a good time to reflect on my experiences not only dating, but now also maintaining a relationship. It may not be my first, but it's been a pretty awesome journey. I hope this will be useful to those interested in talking about and learning more on both, but mostly I just know younger me would have appreciated these notes lol. Long but good, enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">putz</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 09 Aug 2019 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:putz.space,2019-08-09:/blog/two-years-together/</guid><category>personal</category><category>dating</category><category>self-help</category></item></channel></rss>
