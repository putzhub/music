That sparked a few routines that I started to use to keep my life together. I figured some people might find it helpful if I reflected on that journey and how I started adulting. So yeah, enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The titanic sinking in an infomercial" src="https://putz.space/blog/covers/keep-it-together.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Intro&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided I want to openly reflect on how I organize my day to day because I think it could be helpful for people who are asking themselves how to do that. It's not a question I intentionally set out to answer when I started the routines that I use to keep track of my life and accomplish goals. However, these practices have lead me down a path that keep me focused and self aware so that I'm in tune with myself, my needs and where I'm going in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how did I get there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The daily log&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Zim wiki daily log" src="https://putz.space/images/diy/daily-log.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started keeping a daily log on December 17th, 2014. I originally started it because I was in college and I was bored at home over the winter. I was curious about learning the &lt;a href="http://python.org" target="_blank"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; programming language and I thought a good project would be to create my own note-taking software to help me in school. Then I quickly realized it would be a lot of work and decided instead to just find an open source project that someone already started (also written in Python) that would let me take notes more effectively than a bunch of scattered word docs all over My Documents like the rest of people in class. Fun fact, I still have those notes laying around too, even if I hardly reference them. At the time though, I found the software you see in the screenshot to be very useful for school too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting the habit of remembering to log my day was difficult, but not impossible the more I stuck with it. I was also inspired by a Life Pro-Tip I heard a while back on Reddit about keeping notes of all the happy moments in a year, putting them in a jar and opening the jar one New Years to remember the year. So instead of just the happy memories I decided to log the mundane and bad ones too. It's kinda fun to reflect back on and helps avoid the memory rot our brains are prone to when it comes to remembering certain details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there I also had another idea...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;My to-do list&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Zim wiki to-do list" src="https://putz.space/images/diy/todo-list.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being on my own in college meant I had a new level of independence to be free with, but also live up to. In order to keep things straight I started to keep a to-do list, which I figured would go very well with the daily log. The nice thing about that combination is that you can set your goals and confirm with yourself whether you did them or not by simply reading the log. Over the years I've learned how to combine the two to recalibrate my life if I start to notice that I'm not getting done what I need to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this an unrealistic goal? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I just need to define it better so it's more clear what to do? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the hell did I last get a hair cut again? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questions like these and more are easier to answer if you have a running log of your life to double check if you're not even able to keep track of what you ate last for breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these habits helped build into each other so I could maintain a routine that I wouldn't just simply stop doing one day from forgetting to do it. I also made sure that they were both simple enough to keep me doing them. The daily log is a mostly logistical thing for me, but I occassionally engage in more emotionally detailed reflections that I save in LibreOffice docs to go back to once and a while if I want, because that can be helpful for yourself too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main thing though, is organizing what you need to do in your life so that you don't forget to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Getting Things Done&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, that's not accidentally capitalized while the others aren't. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done" target="_blank"&gt;Getting Things Done&lt;/a&gt; is an actual method some weird business lookin' boy from the year 2001 wrote for getting shit done. The software I use, &lt;a href="http://zim-wiki.org" target="_blank"&gt;Zim wiki&lt;/a&gt; includes an abridged explanation of how to integrate it into your workflow through the software, but anyway I'm gonna give you an even simpler run-down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, at some point I realized that my previous methods of keeping track of my to-do list were insufficient so I decided to investigate some more. The way I've adapted Getting Things Done is pretty simple. You don't even need to use the software I do to really implement this into your life, or any of these tips for that matter. You can work it into your life how makes the most sense to you. Creativity is the spice of life and all that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The flow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing you do is identify a task. Can it be done in less than 5 minutes? Then do it! Seriously, stuff like hanging up your clothes, putting a new toilet paper roll on the holder or loading and unloading a dishwasher are stuff that will vastly improve your quality of life without building up into a huge 30 minute mess down the line. So you'll be much better off for just doing them if you have the time. Sometimes we don't though, which is when you go to the next step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;INBOX and to-do list&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Zim wiki Inbox" src="https://putz.space/images/diy/todo-inbox.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I write it down in my INBOX (as seen above) and if I can't think about it at the time then I just come back to it later. When I can take the time to process it (which I have a little reminder to do located at the top of the page so it shows up in Zim wiki's to-do list feature), I'll decide if it's something I genuinely want to put time into or discard. If it's a big project, I'll start to give it it's own space on a page of it's own under the Projects folder, otherwise you can just throw it on your everyday to-do or chores list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A chores list is something I look at frequently to remind myself what tasks I have to keep up with routinely (weekly, monthly, etc). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My to-do list is full of single, line item things that I need to take care of that might be related by subject matter but are independent stuff to do one time, probably at a certain date. Maybe I just have to pay a particular bill instead of one that is recurring for example or I should remember to call up a friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Projects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Zim wiki Project list: Automotive" src="https://putz.space/images/diy/todo-automotive.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Projects folder is where I take what is turning into a huge section of it's own list of related tasks all about one subject or on-going project in my life in the to-do list. My Automotive to-do list for example includes the entire maintenance schedule for my car, problems and repairs as they come up and anything related to my car, because that's how much is going on with it. That way I can make sure I'm up to date on the thing it needs taken care of routinely while keeping track of the small things that come up along the way like any rust spots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Someday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last thing on the side panel you may see is the "SomeDay" folder. It's a place where I put anything I think of that isn't a task that's been formulated in concrete terms of when, what or how to do it. Maybe I would like to learn a thing, write an article or process an idea I'm having in a way more in-depth than my inbox. Or maybe something from the inbox is growing into a larger idea. I honestly haven't found myself using it that much, but it's a recommendation from the Getting Things Done method and I've been using it to just keep track of whims and dreams I have that I don't quite want to give up on yet but don't have any idea about what to do logistically for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you've made it this far you're clearly interested in trying to get your life together. I have found the above practices extremely fruitful when it comes to keeping it together for myself. Like I said, this turned out to be the product of what was more or less an accident and me wanting to nerd out on taking notes about myself because I was in college at the time and found those skills highly useful to transfer into my daily life. Unlike everyone else who went to college and "didn't learn anything useful", I found the mindset of being a self-directed studious individual has allowed me to optimize the way I spend my time so less of it is spent on shit that I've let get way out of control. Instead of letting my mind get scared of being bored and instantly type in facebook.com into my web browser, I try to direct my energies into this, certian times more successfully than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see the memes of people who don't like to plan their life because they want it to be spontaneous or whatever, but actually having my shit all laid out in an easy to keep track of way has allowed me to have the ability to use my free time in the ways I truly want to, instead of dealing with unexpected consequences from letting one area of my life go to shit. It's not to say I don't run into ruts, roadblocks or stressful situations. These routines just allow me to deal with them more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's certainly an element of luck and privilege as with anything in life as to why I've been able to keep my shit together. But I also found these skills useful and fundamental to my life as an adult so that I can be self-aware and on top of my shit. So take it for what you will, but I hope you may find my reflections useful. If you haven't, well my blog helps me process my life too so in the end it's all good anyway lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anything you can at least see where I got the inspiration from for my website's CSS style.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="diy"></category><category term="life"></category><category term="self-help"></category><category term="personal"></category></entry><entry><title>How I learned DIY auto repair</title><link href="https://putz.space/blog/diy-car-repair/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-05-16T22:15:57-05:00</published><updated>2019-05-16T22:15:57-05:00</updated><author><name>putz</name></author><id>tag:putz.space,2019-05-16:/blog/diy-car-repair/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ever since dealing with a crap car, it became clear I needed to learn more about cars. So here's how I did that! I focused on the process because there's already plenty of resources out there for specific repairs. I felt it would be helpful to look at how I prepared to do rust removal on my car as an example to share. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Derpy car" src="https://putz.space/blog/covers/diy-car-repair.png" width="400px" height="250px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Fuckin' cars...&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's make a long story short. I had an ok car that was high maintenance. It sucked. I decided that I was done dealing with the anxiety of what they're gonna find at the shop next. I was sick of wondering if the noises I hear from my car were normal or not. That lead me on my journey to finally learn what the hell is going on inside my car because until public transit is faster than 1.5hr each way to work, I'm gonna have to rely on one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;First steps&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing that you have to do before you can learn about any subject is how to speak the lingo. So I set out to learn the basics about car anatomy and terminology. What is each part called. What's a bearing? Why is it so expensive to repair a head gasket? What is that anyway? Stuff like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need somewhere to start you can always ask any mechanic buddies and see what they would say. Most will probably say they learned from an uncle or someone, so they can maybe help you out actually doing the repair if they're willing to take the time out of their day to do it (compensation helps). But online there are plenty of videos and I personally like reading so I found books to be very helpful as well. Something as simple as "Car Repair for Dummies" was actually quite foundational in explaining what everything is called and their place in your car's system. If you're a woman there are even books written by other women who speak to the particularities of car repair from a woman's perspective (like say, maybe dealing with assholes who don't take you seriously). Maybe there's community college classes. Find what speaks to you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some youtube channels I like, however you may have to search for stuff particular to your car because everyone has different vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PaintballOO7"&gt;ChrisFix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/EricTheCarGuy"&gt;Eric the Car Guy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT5dv3iwFuy041dbWPB6skg"&gt;Ratchets and Wrenches&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/1aauto"&gt;1A Auto Parts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't have to go too deep though to find a lot useful information. If you really don't have the time to get a degree in cars then just take note of anything you have questions about while watching youtube videos and search any terms as you get stuck. This knowledge will accumulate over time even if the initial time investment may be a bit high at first. At the very least, you'll get an idea whether you need to take it in or if you can do it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is though, you need to figure out &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; you need to know and &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to learn it. Apply that to life!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Getting the tools&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to get any tools you'll need to actually apply that knowledge in the real world. The most essential things are going to be stuff like a solid jack, jack stands, a decent socket set and rust penetrant such as PB blaster. But I don't really want to seem like the authority on the matter here, I'm still learning and acquiring what I need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take it from chris fix if you want a full list of tools: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCOgrIPFxIY"&gt;What are the Best Tools for Fixing Cars at Home?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other logistical issues to figure out though besides just the tools. You need a work space. Some places may make it very difficult to do your own repairs which might leave you to reaching out to friends or finding somewhere you can do them. Keep in mind for some repairs you may have to leave your car overnight, so be prepared to have alternative transportation. However, for a lot of stuff you may not even need to lift the car up. There's stuff you can do even if it is limited, but I acknowledge that in some situations it may be really tricky to even do your own repairs. Luckily I have an engineer for a roommate so there's space and tools abound! Hopefully, you can find something that works for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Preparing for rust removal&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started about 2 years ago, I've gained more confidence and experience in doing my own repairs. Given I had a free week to do so, I put together a list of maintenance items. I just finished replacing the wheel bearing, which I decided to do in the most systematic way for any repair I've done yet. It seemed fairly intimidating given the amount of hammering and rust I saw in the videos, but when I actually did it I couldn't believe I was able to drive to work the next day! Car work usually has a sneaky way of being harder than what you see in the videos though, which is why I went to the lengths I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided that for the next repair on the list, rust removal, that I wanted to use it as an example for this blog post. In order to be as successful as possible I decided to type some notes to keep handy during the actual procedure. This isn't necessary for every repair, but for some it can be super helpful in giving you the confidence to attack it, especially if it's going to take a while to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step in that process was to find a video or set of videos to learn from. ChrisFix has a pretty decent video on rust repair that really lays out the whole process very well from start to finish, so it felt like a natural choice. I found his outline at the beginning very helpful in my own notes. (Ignore the WheelBearing heading, I just copy pasted the page I was using to take notes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of Notes" src="https://putz.space/images/diy/how-to-diy-cars-notes2.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This later expanded into headings that would have all the more detailed steps that he elaborates on. For the finished notes, &lt;a href="https://putz.space/diy/rust-removal"&gt;click this link here&lt;/a&gt;. I wrote down each important detail that I would be asking myself as I'm going along with the list on my own. What grit sand paper will I need for each step? How do I actually sand and apply paint? Prior experience helped me think about some of the ways problems come up while doing a repair and to be ready to address them. Be specific, don't just say "Sand the rust", be sure to explain to yourself &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to sand the rust with &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my notes I started a document with the link to the video for future reference, the necessary tools and the list of steps to actually do the repair. For other repairs you'll probably want to add parts necessary to replace with prices or even the torque spec for each fastener that needs it. But for our example I only needed to know the steps and what to buy. If you do this for all repairs you'll have your own little wikipedia of car repairs to reference if you ever need to do it again, making the next time much more efficient! You can update it with whatever lessons you learned while doing it too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Doing the repair&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before publishing this I wanted to do the repair myself to make sure I'm not just an idiot spouting shit off that doesn't actually work. The first major change to my plan was that in the end, with the advisory of a car friend, that the rust on my door was way too much to bother sanding down. It's even bigger than what I found in the video I was working on, so I felt like that made sense. It would be so full of holes that there'd be nothing left to fill and paint! The risk that the rust will just come back made it not worth bothering to do, so in the end I've hunted down a door that I found at a used parts place which I'll be putting on instead that doesn't have any rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there was still some minor rust spots on my car that I ended up needing to address before they got bigger. They were all on the body under the bottom of all the doors except for the rear driverside one which actually was in really good shape. The notes I typed up were still very useful for this even though I ended up not needing to follow the sections on using body filler. It still laid out the basic process to follow with what I need to do to be successful. I took notes on parts that I had questions on or trouble with to help for the next time I do rust removal. At the end of the day the best way is to learn by doing though to add to your experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this was probably that shocking or may have even been common sense for people who are already used to doing DIY stuff. This was basically a space for me to reflect on my own process and try to help others by going through a repair that anyone with a car might need to do. Hopefully it's been helpful for you!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="diy"></category><category term="auto"></category></entry></feed>
