<p>If you saw a flyer on your door and noticed the putz.space URL in the email that you saw, then you've found my blog!</p>
<p>Long story short, times are weird. There's pandemic going on and society is shutting down. It's a bit scary to be honest. That means some people might need help financially. People might need help getting their groceries. Others might be willing to help people in their time of need with free food or a helping hand. Others yet maybe just want to get connected with their neighbors in these alienating times.</p>
<p>If you respond to my flyer I'll be connecting you to others in the community who also feel the need for that. I'll connect you to the email list and group chat where we can stay in touch. Feel free to join the facebook group for the neighborhood, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/whittiercares">Whittier Cares.</a> </p>
<p>That's it really. I'm just trying to build the connections we'll need to take care of one another and get through this. If that sounds appealing to you then feel free to <a href="mailto:neighbors@putz.space">contact me.</a></p>

I thought it would be a good time to reflect on my experiences not only dating, but now also maintaining a relationship. It may not be my first, but it's been a pretty awesome journey. I hope this will be useful to those interested in talking about and learning more on both, but mostly I just know younger me would have appreciated these notes lol. Long but good, enjoy!</p>

After reading it they were asking themself if they could genuinely leave Facebook. That inspired me to ask the question on my feed "What keeps you on Facebook?", hoping that I could write about my experience leaving and what I did to replace the things that kept me there.

I was on Mastodon and Reddit, but nobody I know really uses them so I figured I'd come back. Most of you are on here and the people is what makes social media meaningful. So what up what up yo.</p>
