<p><em>Embedded for your listening pleasure as you read this review. Link below if it doesn't work.</em></p>
<p>In the course of asking people what they'd like to see on the blog, Justin Haze of <a href="https://truedelusions.bandcamp.com/">True Delusions</a> reached out asking if I could review his album. Truth be told I've never done such a thing, but I decided  why not! To disclose my own biases at the start, I'd like to say I normally don't seek out the genre this album is done in. I try to approach music with an open mind generally, but everyone still has their own personal tastes and preferences when it comes to such things, so I just wanted to put that out there as full disclosure. Normally you'll find me adding video game music, jazz, drum &amp; bass, r&amp;b, hip-hop, house music and sprinklings of dub techno to my music library with some occassional rock, country and once in a while more popular music. Indie-folk stuff is in my library, just not the biggest section.</p>
<p>Anyway, now that that's out of the way.</p>
<p>When we first enter the world of True Delusions we're greeted with a bouncing beat that quickly explodes into the distorted chug of a cheery electric guitar and dreamy vocals that hovers between being a story and a melody. The story I piece together from the instruments and vocals is about love, sex and, of course, rock n roll. In many ways the chaotic distortion and story actually fits together nicely to me. If the goal is to paint the picture of a rocky love story, nailed it! If not, then oh god I've horribly misread what's supposed to be going on lol.</p>
<p>As the album goes on it takes a more subdued path that becomes even trippier and troubled. I'll admit I'm already bad with following lyrics, so I'm not sure if the vocals contradict with the feeling I get from them at all, but I get a sense of longing, misunderstanding and the bending reality under pressure. When things are more positive and uplifting, I'm struck with a feeling of confidence and purpose that is reflected in the clarity and power of the vocals and the uplifting energy the drums &amp; guitar provides. When things feel more subdued and sad, I feel the sense of confusion and meloncholy. I like how it oscillates between projecting a sadder tone while moving back to optimistic tones and upbeat energy in the way that love and life often does.</p>
<p>The whole album feels metaphoric and poetic. What I find particularly relatable, personally, is using music as a way to understand your own feelings and as a form of therapy which I get a sense of while I listen to this.</p>
<p>As for personal reaction, I was actually surprised with the album as a whole. I'll admit some songs don't resonate with me in the way that it might for others who are in the emotional space to vibe with them, but other songs are actually really well done and I like them quite a bit. Some of my personal favorites include: I Unloaded Them And Dropped 'Em, Candle Lit, Are Distorting Again, Old Earth Angel and Thanks With Many Breaths. Not that I would say the others were "bad", but rather I found myself enjoying these more maybe because they relate more to where I'm at emotionally.</p>
<p>I'm impressed by how professional the album sounds and seeing Justin's work develop and grow like this is quite cool. A big difference is probably due to this being recorded in an actual studio versus what I'm assuming was home equipment from songs I've heard in the past. I'm impressed how it still captures the distorted, chaotic feel of his old work while sounding well-mastered and crisp. I particularly like how the guitar throughout the album is twisted and distorted in subtle, yet dope ways that reflect a variety of emotions.</p>
<p>Congrats on finishing the album dude!</p>
