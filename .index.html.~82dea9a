<h2>The new social media</h2>
<p>If you haven't heard yet, I've joined a new social media platform called Mastodon. It part of <a href="https://fediverse.party/en/fediverse/" target="_blank">"The Fediverse"</a>, where a bunch of different social media platforms co-exist. To make a long story short, I'm inviting people to join me!</p>
<h2>Why join?</h2>
<p>Social media these days is creepy, and at worst downright harmful. Platforms like Facebook &amp; Instagram spy on you to sell you products, ideas and even just memes. They jumble it all together on a mysterious feed that you don't control then selectively show content from friends (often just sharing the same ads) at random to keep you coming back so it actually has any meaning.</p>
<p>In short, it's hard to actually connect with people. It's like being in a bar so noisy that you can barely think over the ads to buy beer blaring over the speakers.</p>
<p>The Fediverse is seeking to change that. It allows you to build an online community that's better connected. It allows that community to run things how it wants while still being connected to other servers and platforms doing the exact same thing so it's still global.</p>
<p>I'm inviting you to come build that community.</p>
<p>I use the word <em>build</em> on purpose, because it's going to take some effort. If I just shared this invitation with you over the regular Facebook feed without reaching out directly, you'd probably miss it or scroll passed. Facebook has gone to the lengths it has to build a particular kind of community, one that collectively consumes information for sale. It's not an accident that it operates the way it does.</p>
<p>It's going to take some work to build an alternative, but I think that in these times we can't afford not to. On one hand, I just want to connect with friends and see how y'all are doing without it getting lost in Facebook's manipulative bullshit. You don't have to be political, think a certain way or have a certain goal in mind. You can share memes, jokes, posts about your day or whatever game/movie you're checking out right now.</p>
<p>On the other hand though, I see this as an important way to stay connected to people I know who care about the world. Because of resource limitations and also to maintain a cohesive community, I've reached out selectively to some close friends that I think would be interested in this project to start. Feel free to invite others too! I think you're all really cool people though that are worth staying in touch with. In order to deal with the bullshit that the world is going through right now, it's going to be good to have this space to talk to one another.</p>
<p>You don't even have to leave Facebook either if you don't want. That's the beauty of this, it's not exclusive. It's just a quieter place where you can  still be social without wading through a toxic swamp.</p>
<h2>How to join?</h2>
<p>There are technically other servers where you can sign up, but I've opened up my own server with the purpose of connecting people I know. Think of it as being in my living room or out on the porch chillin'.</p>
<p>Think of Mastodon like Twitter, but without so many assholes. </p>

I thought it would be a good time to reflect on my experiences not only dating, but now also maintaining a relationship. It may not be my first, but it's been a pretty awesome journey. I hope this will be useful to those interested in talking about and learning more on both, but mostly I just know younger me would have appreciated these notes lol. Long but good, enjoy!</p>
