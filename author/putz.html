<p>tags: <a href="https://putz.space/tag/personal.html">personal</a></p></footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Hey everyone! So it's probably been a while since you've heard from me because I dropped off of facebook and started interacting way less with social media. For many people reading this we probably haven't talked since I was in college. Even if we have, it probably hasn't been as frequently.</p>
<p>I've decided to start this website as one way for people to see what I'm up to. I realize this probably won't be something most people come back to regularly, if at all, but since you're reading this I figured I'd let you know what I'm up to anyway.</p>
<p>I bought <a href="#">putz.space</a> as a way to have a consistent email since I finally decided to switch away from gmail as my primary email. Check the <a href="https://putz.space/about/">about</a> page if you want to send me an email or connect on social media. You can still technically reach me at my old email, it just might get lost with all the unread emails lol. After buying a domain name though, it was a logical next step to start a website.</p>
<p>I actually had a website back in middle and high school that I worked on as a hobby for myself. I'd like to do that again. I want it to be the central place where you can go to see what I'm up to. In fact, if you want me to link to what <em>you're</em> doing, then let me know and I can make a page for my friends who are doing cool shit too!</p>
<p>The first thing that made the most sense to me is obviously hosting my music, because I am Groove Masta Putz after all lol. In fact, if you're interested in a mailing list for any new tracks, <a href="mailto:inbox@putz.space">email me</a> and I'll add you for when I actually make one in the future.</p>
<p>However, I've also been trying to think of what else might be interesting to people. So another thing I'd like to try is write up tutorials and other useful posts for stuff that can guide people through some things that I've done like: make this website, how I organize my life, how to follow news sources without Facebook or Reddit, or how to hack your wii to play all the dope old school games and much more. If there's something else you'd like to see let me know! Ideas are welcome and they don't have to be nerd shit either necessarily. I just want to motivate myself to do cool things.</p>
<p>I'm still figuring this out as I go, but I'm trying to think big. The most exciting thing to me is having an online space again that's mine. With facebook and other social media I no longer felt like the people I care about were seeing me behind all the ads and secret algorithms. Plus, it was limited and a full website gives me more control over what I can host and how. For example, I can take my <a href="https://putz.space/music/">music</a> page more seriously and get in-depth about each song and its history.</p>
<p>There's a lot more I want to say, but I guess that's what future blog posts will be for. Hope y'all are doing well out there, it's a crazy world these days. Definitely weird to be an adult now, but that's just how it be, huh. </p>
<p>Feel free to say hi if we haven't talked in a while!</p>                </article>
