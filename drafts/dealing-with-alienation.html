<p>If you follow me at all, you may have noticed that I haven't been posting much lately. That's for a few reasons, but mainly it's because I haven't had the time and energy to put into being creative like I used to. Alienation is something that everyone deals with, so you may find this post helpful in understanding your own. If not, at least this post will explain why I've been less active in the last months.</p>
<p>I'm doing somewhat better now than I was. That's why I'm able to write this post in the first place. That said, I still struggle with alienation, depression and anxiety because those are inescapable elements of the current society we live in. Thankfully, now I'm in a place where I can talk about the emotional pit I was in and how I've gotten into a better spot mentally.</p>
<p><strong>Outline:</strong></p>
<p>Talk about the cycle of working everyday, seeing depressing news every day, becoming politically disconnected, only seeing a select group of friends every weekend and not being able to explore creative outlets.</p>
<p>Then talk about the counteracting tendencies that pulled me out of those ruts (actually doing the above things that I wanted to, working out, making changes, and most importantly talking about alienation with others).</p>
<p>Talk about the inertia of sadness that digs you deeper into the cycle and the ways it interferes with your ability to counter it. The increasing sense of hopelessness ate away at me, especially without stronger counteracting routines to keep me grounded (political, work out routines, etc).</p>
<h2>The cycle of the daily grind</h2>
<p>It's hard to say exactly when my latest depression spiral started. In fact, I've had lots of episodes of depression and anxiety well before this, but the most recent has been especially challenging. There isn't a single day I can point to and say "yep, this is where it all started", because it's deeper than that. I've noticed it's a cycle that fluctuates, even throughout a single day.</p>
<p>To make a long story short, I was recently promoted to full time at work a few months ago. If you've ever worked full time (or god forbid, more) then you'll know it's exhausting. There is no stop. Any time I'm not working is either spent recovering from work or doing chores to get ready to go back to work. On occasion I get to see whoever is left of my friends a night or two a week. Then it's back to work doing the same shit over and over and over...</p>
<p>It doesn't matter how much you like your job, because 8 hours a day is a lot of time to spend doing something. The only thing people spend more time doing is sleeping, at least if they're lucky enough to get as much as they should (my work screensaver says 40% of adults don't). It's not as simple as finding a different job either, because there are no jobs that will leave you financially stable working part-time unless you're extremely privileged.</p>
<p>The thing is, I <em>like</em> my job. That's what is so depressing. I'm doing what I went to school for, I'm well taken care of and most people would be jealous to be in my shoes. <em>I am supposed to be happy with this.</em></p>
<p>The contradiction between stability and free time slowly eats away at me during the week. I often blur through the motions of doing what I need to so I can get home. I do what I can to forget that my life isn't really mine and belongs to the "job creators" who so <em>benevolently</em> (sarcasm) provide me a paycheck.</p>
<p>I find that work brings me down the most when I'm not actually needed. There's often downtime, so it's in those moments when I become the most depressed unless I have some way to reclaim that time like learning a new skill, reading a book, making a blog post, etc.</p>
<p>When I'm actually busy and feel needed it's easier to feel like what I'm doing matters in spite of how much time it sucks up. Eventually though, even running at that pace for too long can become tedious, because the reality is that life under capitalism <em>is</em> tedious. There's no summer break, holidays are just a long weekend and sick days are sinful abdications of your responsibility to "add value" to the economy.</p>
<h2>Losing myself</h2>
<p>Ever since leaving college I've been going through a transition of identity and purpose, which isn't surprising. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but recently it's been more challenging than usual. There are factors besides work which have contributed to that, but as the days slip by at work I find that I don't know who I am anymore.</p>
<p>The meaning I found before in being creative, politically active and socializing are basically gone.</p>
<p>The political organization I was with has fallen a part because of a sexual assault cover-up, among other problems that existed with leadership. I haven't found a new outlet that's filled that void, so every time I see political news now I'm filled with despair instead of any sense that there's a movement capable of empowering working people. After continued defeats, personal and societal, there's a lot of times that I don't feel the urge to organize anymore. I'll often just want to die in peace before the climate apocalypse ruins whatever is left of this place.</p>
<p>I have no time to produce music like I did before. I still find time to jam with friends on occasion thankfully, but most of it stays on my computer or unrecorded. Making an album feels pointless when I barely even get the chance to listen to music anymore. Who would listen to it anyway? Calling myself "Groove Masta Putz" feels like a memory from a distant time.</p>
<p>I basically have a handful of friends that I rarely have time to see. When I do it's nice, but waiting 5 days to see a monthly rotation of people for a couple of hours doesn't fill the void. Even living with my fantastic and amazing partner only helps so much because we barely have free time. When I was in college I felt a sense of community and met new people regularly. I haven't added someone's number in my phone to hang out in well over a year, if not more.</p>
<p>[I tried making a Facebook account again to connect with people](link to post) I knew but that went about as well as you can imagine. [Making putz social (a Mastodon instance)](link to post) has been helpful but not necessarily for real world social interaction. Social media doesn't really solve the problem of working too much to hang out.</p>
<p>There's been other changes too, but those are the biggest. Things that were important in giving me meaning are effectively gone. [When I see headlines about how millennials are depressed as fuck and more suicidal], it comes as no surprise to me and oddly gives me a sense of connection.</p>
<p>So how the hell do I overcome that?</p>
<h2>Routines and connections</h2>
<p>Saying that I've "overcome" any of this is premature, but I do feel better than the lowest points I had reached this time around. Hell during the course of writing this I've had some ups and downs. None of this should be considered professional medical advice, either. It's just my own experience and what I've noticed recently about myself. By blogging about it though I hope to understand myself better in an open way that others can get ideas from.</p>
<p>There wasn't one singular thing or event that started to counteract the spiral I was falling into. The natural rhythm of the work day and week plays a role in my mood, like getting out of work and the weekend make me feel better of course.</p>
<p>An important step has been identifying my triggers. These are the things that make me start to have depressing thoughts, hopelessness or whatever you want to call it. For me, reading depressing headlines and news articles is a big one. That and Reddit comments which has been harder to stop than I'd like to admit.</p>
<p>When work is slow and I have little motivation, it's easy to fill the boredom gap with social media. Mastodon has thankfully provided a healthy social media space, but before when I was at my worst and on Facebook and Reddit all the time, it would quickly eat away at my psyche. So I deleted Facebook and I use web browser extensions to make Reddit unusable if it becomes too much. Reading books, either fiction or self-help have been good alternatives for my boredom.</p>
<p>Socializing was an important way to counteract the depression spirals as well. In fact, I would say it's been the most important. A good friend I hadn't seen in a while hit me up to come hang out, which gave me something to look forward to during the week. Alongside that, on the Friday of that week one of my co-workers checked in because people at work noticed I was quieter than usual. From there we had a pretty in-depth conversation on the concept of alienation which helped me feel better because we all talked about the ways that it affects us. Just hanging out with friends on the weekends has been important too.</p>
<p>One of the conversations I had with the friend who came into town was about exercise. While I had my own routine, I found that I was starting to plateau again. This inspired me to start looking into a new workout routine, which gave me something new to start researching at work on my downtime. The mental health benefits itself from working out are good, but so was the purpose I found in researching a new routine.</p>
