<h1>Intro</h1>
<p>Today is a special day, because it's been two years since I met the love of my life. She's pretty special and I feel quite lucky to have found her. Sadly you, the Internet, probably won't meet her unless you know me personally, which is unfortunate cause she's great. </p>
<p>Hopefully though, you'll still find this reflection useful anyway, because I'd like to talk more about my experiences dating in general as well as how we've maintained our relationship up until now. </p>
<p>Disclaimer, I'm not an expert in relationships, dating or even social whatevering. I'm just reflecting on my own experiences in going from a nerdy high schooler with no sex appeal to someone that was actually fun to be around and sexy. Your mileage may vary, especially if you're a person of color, queer or someone that has a different experience from the typical heteronormative culture assumed to be "standard" that pervades a lot of societies across the world.</p>
<p>I'd like to think everyone can get a little something out of my ramblings though hopefully. </p>
<h1>Dating</h1>
<h2>A long and bumpy road</h2>
<p>I wasn't always as confident in myself as who I am now. Most people don't start that way, or in some cases get there, anyway. I was kinda glad that I was too nerdy and awkward in high school anyway to be in a relationship. It saved a lot of drama and heartache, but at the time I was pretty worried about finding someone and you know, doin' it or whatever.</p>
<p>Believe it not I once uttered the cringiest phrase ever by telling someone that my goal was to become the most attractive man in the world or  stupid shit like that. A bit ambitious, but you know, shoot for the stars, etc.</p>
<p>TO BE CONTINUED</p>
<h1>Maintaining a relationship</h1>
<p>Talk more about how we've maintained our relationship, challenges and other thoughts.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
