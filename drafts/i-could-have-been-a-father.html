<p class="tag-list"><a href="https://putz.space/tag/personal.html">#personal</a> <a href="https://putz.space/tag/politics.html">#politics</a> </p></footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I was almost a father. Sometimes I don't appreciate that fact as much as I should, because at times it feels like it never happened and honestly most days I don't even think about it. At least, not until lately with the numerous abortion bans being rammed through various state legislatures. </p>
<p>The person who had to get the abortion though still has trouble speaking about it to this day and is probably fucking <em>furious</em> that I can even say that. I don't blame her at all if she is or even if you, the reader, are. In fact, she's asked me not to talk about it so I'm writing this in a way that should hopefully protect her identity. If you're seeing this I've gotten her permission to post it though. But she's the one you should be sympathizing with, not me. However, I can only tell you this story from my perspective unfortunately.</p>
<p>I would have been a horrible father. I would not have moved to be closer to my child because I couldn't. The line of work I do wouldn't be able to support me where she lived. Quite frankly, I wouldn't have wanted to move anyway. We had already agreed it was the best course of action to get an abortion before it was on the table, so there wasn't really a question about how to take care of things when she called me late at night, horrified. In fact, she never wanted to call me to tell me in the first place. I can't blame her, given how terrifying it is to accept that reality. I'm glad she did though.</p>
<p>I offered my support, but in the end I was too far away to be any help and quite frankly it was probably better that I couldn't be there in person to stress her out even more than I already did by the simple fact I was a man trying to help someone going through something I could never understand. I wish I could have been there to even feel some of the consequences or hear an inkling of the despair behind the sobbing I'm assuming happened, because it took a while to understand even though I knew theoretically it was a horrible thing to go through. I never had to deal with the nausea from taking a Plan B pill, the mental stress of pretending everything is fine when you've got an unwanted child in your uterus as people ask "Hey! How are you?" or any of the numerous things I missed out on.</p>
<p>At the very least I made sure she knew I supported her decision to get the abortion still, I was willing to help financially or with transportation (which she denied in the end) and that she's not a monster but that she's making the right choice. Because while some may want to point the finger and say we were irresponsible for doing the very natural thing of having sex, it would have been even more irresponsible to bring a child into this world whose parents would have absolutely resented it.</p>
<p>At least I would have. I don't want to speak for her, because that's her story to tell and not mine. My story though is that if I was pro-choice on paper before, I'm willing to fight for it now to save both those who can't be mothers and those who shouldn't be fathers from a life I could have faced if she couldn't get that abortion. </p>
<p>The abstract arguments can be easy to get lost in if you haven't been affected. What if a fetus can feel? What if they would have cured cancer? It's God's choice! OMG A HEART BEAT.</p>
<p>Fuck that. Because the second it's born nobody would have given a shit. Nobody would have had any sympathy for a single mother who gave birth to a child that could have suffered from fetal alcohol syndrome because she didn't even know she was pregnant until it was too late to take the precautions necessary to raise a child. Nobody would have cared that she had medical bills out her ass for a mistake that was also my fault. Nobody would have cared that I wasn't in the picture because they would never see me behind her struggle to keep it together daily. </p>
<p>She could have had her life ruined because of my stupid ass and mine would be a hell of a lot more complicated.</p>
<p>This is why I'm pro-choice. This is why I will show up to defend abortion clinics when I can and rally with the feminists who fight for the freedom to control their bodies that men like me also benefit from. Because what was a shitty accident could have turned into a big fucking unncessary mess. I don't need some abstract bullshit argument about what a fetus can and can't feel to know that that it doesn't matter more than the person carrying it.</p>
<p>Not even the leaders of the so-called "pro-life" movement care because they work to pass bills that put women in prisons for miscarriages. They even want to pass a bill in Texas that would give the fucking death penalty for abortions in a full display of hypocrisy that perfectly exposes "anti-choice" legislation for what it is: control over women.</p>
<p>Being pro-choice doesn't mean that I'm against babies or birth either. The other side of the fight for reproductive justice means funding healthcare, childcare and schools so that people who want children can raise them to become fully supported human beings. It means taking care of the people who are already born. We have enough people in this world that the anti-choice politicians and forced birthers don't care about, I didn't need to help add another one to that list. If they gave a shit about life we would see them fighting for taking care of that life, but they often times don't, especially if it's black or brown.</p>
<p>But being pro-choice doesn't just end at birth for me. Being pro-choice ties into a larger question about autonomy. If you don't think that other people should be able to tell you whether or not you can smoke weed, go to the bathroom, identify as whatever gender or non-gender you prefer, or even if you think slavery should be illegal it's all tied to the same question: Should we be allowed to control others?</p>
<p>It's not just some stupid wedge issue that is becoming increasingly hard to distinguish on the ever narrowing platform gap that republicans and democrats run on. It's the difference between whether or not we as a society believe that people have autonomy and rights to live fulfilling lives or if they're property for the rich to exploit as they please. Because you can be damn sure these rules don't apply to the rich when they need an abortion.</p>
